<h2>Hi there I'm John</h2>
<! img src= "XXX">
<h3>About Me</h3>
Most of my life has been spent living in and around Leeds with a brief 3 year stint studying in Newcastle (back in the heady days of Maddisons, Walkers and Ritzys). <br>
Work wise I am currently working remotely as part of  a Product Team providing online services in the finance sector.
<br>I've been around a bit so we wont go in to age but I have three kids all at school with youngest half the age of the eldest ( does that help?)

<p></p>
<h3>Why I'm doing this</h3>
<p>I'm curious about everything , I have to know how things work, usually by breaking them to see if they can be fixed.  I've been playing at building sites for years but only at a hobbyist level, it would be nice not to have to crib the funkier work of others and code the trickier bits (JavaScript) from scratch  </p>
<h3>What I like</h3>
Obviously I have to say my family , but I do like to sneak away for a round of golf when circumstances permit
<p></p>
<i>So thats me ...</i>
